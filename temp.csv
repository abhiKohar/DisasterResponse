"The weather forecast indicates that rains should go on until at least late December. The severe drought parching east Africa has left 10 million facing hunger and the scope of one of the world's worst unfolding humanitarian disasters conjured up memories of Ethiopia's devastating 1984 famine. Seismologists agree that Padang will face more earthquakes in future, and warn that a much larger quake with far greater destructive force is inevitable in the region. The flash floods that followed torrential monsoonal rains in north-west Pakistan between 28 and 30 July have caused great loss of life and wide-spread damage to infrastructure, livestock and property in more than 100 villages. Lesotho and Swaziland would also experience scattered rains, he noted. But while floodwaters have subsided in some areas, there has been fresh flooding in the north of the state and more heavy rainfall forecast elsewhere. Approximately 1.9 million people have been affected in the past week by heavy torrential monsoon rains which flooded 195 blocks in 14 districts of the State of West Bengal. Separately, the West Java administration has said it plans to once more dredge the Citarum river to reduce the mass of sedimentation that contributes to the area's annual floods. With the help of the American Red Cross, Mr. Fernando and his family are using a compost bin to help remove from the streets household garbage that blocks drains and causes flooding. Continuing, he said the United Nations and its partners were also pursuing ways to promote water harvesting and implement modernized irrigation facilities so communities in the region were not totally dependent on rainwater to keep crops alive during dry spells. It may be mentioned here that long range forecasts of the Indian southwest monsoon rainfall are generated by many other national and global centres which employ different prediction techniques. The availability of feed from grain and crop residues has also fallen sharply due to the drop in agricultural production, especially in rainfed areas. Last year, hundreds of people died in several avalanches following record snowfalls. The northern and eastern parts of the country received less rain in the past northeastern monsoon and expect inter monsoonal showers these days. The initial assessments indicated that nearly 15,000 people had been affected - already double the estimates made on Tuesday - with over 8,000 left without shelter and two people dead. The southern African nation of Mozambique has once again been inundated by flood waters and hurricane force winds. Furthermore, the most recent cyclone to hit the country, tropical storm Manou, killed more than 70 people in May, severed roads and bridges and caused extensive damage to agricultural land. A blanket of acrid smog covered the sweltering capital itself, worsening the woes of Muscovites gasping in Russia's hottest weather since record-keeping began around 1880. Where localised flooding has forced the evacuation of whole communities, the authorities have moved residents to safer areas. This rapid-response shipment includes critically needed supplies to care for the thousands injured in Saturday's disaster: first-aid supplies, materials for making casts to set broken arms and legs, walkers, canes, crutches, warm weather clothing for hospital patients and hygiene kits. Further bad weather is predicted, with the government issuing a cyclone warning for Karachi and other coastal communities in the coming days. Two people were killed when a tree uprooted by the wind fell on them at a village in Chandpur district 170 km (106 miles) southeast of the capital Dhaka on Sunday. 4-7 February: Torrential rain coupled with seasonal rainfall leads to some of the worst flooding in Mozambique in more than half a century.

Inhabitants found it extremely hard to travel and had to suffer a real ordeal by having to use remote unmaintained roads and unconventional means of transport. Islandwide, 540,000 homes were left temporarily without power. Basic household items: The TRCO and the Federation have provided 5,205 families living in prefabricated houses with items such as blankets, quilts, a water boiler, and a radio. They included the provision of emergency shelters and winterisation kits, provision of transport and medical screening. At around 5:40 this morning, the MINUSMA compound in Kidal was targeted by a complex attack involving more than 30 rockets and shells.

Provincial and local authorities are mobilising human and material resouces to restore the cut telecommunications and transportation in the worst affected areas. After consultation with WHO, provision of first aid kits to community-sourced fire fighters as well as a number of non-pharmaceutical medicines (such as oral rehydration salts, antiseptics, sterile saline eyewash, etc.) is suggested. IR is now building permanent and earthquake resistant structures in Aceh, 100 of these have already been completed. However, the sources confirmed that all the nine gates of auxiliary spillway were operating round-the-clock and a large quantity of water, about 175,000 cusecs, was being released daily, while an additional release of 100,000 plus cusecs was also spilling out of the dam during the electricity generation process.

MRTV said Cyclone Giri had struck the coast near the town of Kyaukphyu, with winds reaching 100 miles per hour (160 kph). Paleoclimate records show that even greater climate swings have occurred in Africa's monsoons, most likely related to past variations in solar output and in Earth's orbit. New Delhi - The Indian Air Force continued its operations to provide succor to the earthquake affected people of Jammu & Kashmir for the third consecutive day today. In China,at 3pm their time today,an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the richter scale hit the Wenchuan county in SichuanProvince. By the end of March, eight districts had surpassed the epidemic threshold for the disease and four other districts were placed on alert. Another set of 46 clones resistant to cassava mosaic disease (CMD) was introduced in 2005 from EARRNET coordination through Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Services (KEPHIS). The Mercy, a former supertanker commissioned in 1986 for use by the US Navy's Sealift Command, is equipped with a range of medical facilities including X-ray suites and laboratories and can receive 300 patients daily. As of Tuesday, the local disaster mitigation agency had recorded 1,520 families in Tempurejo district to have fled their homes, as well as 1,230 families in Sumberbaru, 487 families in Semboro, 230 in Wuluhan, 40 in Ambulu and 40 in Jenggawah. On his part, geologist Dr. Salah Mahmoud told KUNA that Duwaika was of a geologically rocky nature, mostly consisting of lime rocks, which could be easily eroded by leaking water from inadequate sewage systems. Most of these movements were associated with the strong southerly winds on 18-19 February. As a public entity, the 240-bed Hipolito Unanue Regional Hospital in Tacna, Peru, serves the needs of thousands of medically indigent families who reside in this southern, coastal region of the country. The solution was to begin using crops better suited to arid regions, such as jojoba (Simmondsia californica), a shrub or small tree producing edible seeds containing a valuable oil used in cosmetics. The Deputy Director emphasized to people living along the Chao Phraya River as well as in river basins of the Northeast and the East to keep a close watch on the local water situation during this period due to the surging rivers. That's what happened when we began the 4 hour travel to Narowal District on 5 September under showery skies. In Laos, where Typhoon Keimi also added to the havoc caused by the rain-swollen Mekong, some 7,000 families are being provided with food and other support to ensure they survive the lean period until the upcoming harvest.

The Asia Foundation's programs for the tsunami are all privately funded. Regional temperature and precipitation patterns. The magnitude and location may change slightly as additional data are received from other seismograph stations. Many schools in the coastal area of Aceh, Indonesia, were either totally destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami on December 26, 2004. There's also volatility, of a different kind, on Aceh's west-coast highway, a lifeline for reconstruction aid. Such a Web-based model, McKinnie said, sets a common framework for inundation modeling in the region and also addresses national restrictions on the use of sensitive bathymetric (measuring the sea bottom along the coast) and similar data for inundation modeling and mapping -- one of the most serious obstacles to modeling and mapping in the region. Early prospects are favorable for 2002/03 winter grains, with adequate winter precipitation recharging soil-moisture reserves. Normally, insect numbers tend to remain low and largely un-noticed, but when changes occur in the environment, such as weather changes or the food balance, or changes in the pest/natural enemy balance, or even due to some forms of human interference, insect populations can explode suddenly to give rise to what happened recently in Liberia with these caterpillars.

"Since 22 November 2008, there has been 719.4 mm of rainfall and cyclonic winds up to 80km/hr in the Jaffna Peninsula causing widespread flooding. Typhoon Parma, packing gusts of 230 kilometres (145 miles) an hour, was forecast to hit rural areas in the north of the Philippines' main island of Luzon before dawn on Saturday. Output was reduced as a result of a shortage of irrigation water following a mild winter and poor management of water resources, with catastrophic impacts on agriculture in the down river regions of the AmuDarya, the Autonomous Region of Karakalpakstan and Khorizem, but particularly the former. On April 18, a second eruption occurred, resulting in a volcanic mudflow, also referred to as a lahar. Therefore, we request all our supporters and friends to please consider donating for these emergency food relief aids for flood victims. **May 12** A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck in the afternoon during our aid distribution and multiple strong aftershocks followed. The Swiss Ministry for Defence, Civil Protection and Sports is also preparing to send emergency power generators and medicine. The strongest wind force measured near the centre of Tropical Depression No. 8 was at Beaufort Scale 6 (39 to 49 kilometres per hour), with wind gusting to above Beaufort Scale 6. The main types of schemes developed by SCF are shallow wells, birkas, ponds and haffir dams (earthen dams). Relief experts on the scene say unusually heavy rains during the past two months have put up to 1.8 million children and family members at risk in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite the favourable forecast for the summer (Kharif) cropping season in monsoon rains receiving areas, preliminary meteorological forecast indicates that availability of irrigation water will decline by 55 to 65 percent during the early part of Kharif season (April to June) and 16 to 26 percent in the latter part of the season (July to September) due to the cumulative effects of low rainfall seasons, including the main monsoon season. For a second time in less than a month, DPR Korea has been affected by floods triggered by torrential rainfalls produced by Typhoon Rusa. * Reduced mortality and morbidity among women, adolescents and children due to post-flood outbreak of communicable and infectious diseases. The Miyagi government said the series of major quakes had caused damage estimated at least 120 million yen (one million dollars) to the farming and fisheries industries in the area. However, there is normally a risk of late season pests such as quelea birds, sweet potato butterfly, stem-borers, African bollworm, stem rust, Welo bush cricket (affecting wheat, barley and teff), shoot-fly (affecting teff) and even locust at the end of the kiremt rains and before the main harvest. The Board approved assistance grants to five Muslim Communities in non member countries in India, USA, Malawi, Mauritius and Russia, in addition to educational grants to Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Somalia. Among the 19 provinces affected by the three weeks of storms, were the badly-hit southern Chinese provinces of Hunan and Guizhou, more famed for their chilli peppers and subtropical climate than for heavy snow. In the Broghal and Yarkhoon valleys of Chitral District (Northern Areas), some 4000 vulnerable persons are completely cut off and isolated as a result of continuous snowfall since December 2004. WHO recommends that the Government take immediate action to reduce the risk of dengue transmission and mitigate the impact of the dengue epidemic. Compared to 2003 when 60,000 people were affected, the 2004 floods has had less impact on the flood prone areas compared to previous years for several reasons; in Central Kenya, there was less rain on the Aberdare Mountains which usually overflows the dams and causes severe flooding downstream. Several small aftershocks have been registered since the quake, and information received indicate there might be further strong quakes because of the massive tectonic plate movements on 26 December. Due to rains floods and landslides have caused disruption to major road communication network in Lohit, Yingkiong, Changlang, Seppa, Anini, Roing & Along district. ""The findings attributed the poor harvest to unpredictable rainfall patterns as the rains which were less than normal and sparsely distributed started late and ended early,"" she noted. The worst flooding to hit the state in nearly 50 years followed catastrophic monsoon rains in northern and northeastern India, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh that killed hundreds and left millions homeless. Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades"", said the CSE."

"The Government of Indonesia is already stretched from various natural disasters, including the imminent eruption of Mt Merapi, and has limited resources to respond to this emergency. In May we told you about efforts to stem sunn pest outbreaks in Faryab - an insect that can cause losses of 20-70 percent in wheat crops with damage reaching 100 percent in the absence of control measures. FAO warned that other Red Sea and Gulf of Aden countries could face important infestations of the cropdevouring insects this winter due to unusually good rains and favorable ecological conditions. Much of Manado's essential infrastructure  -  roads, bridges and drainages  -  have been severely damaged. Of these 301 were rescued by the Norwegian cargo vessel, the Tampa, after their boat sank, and the other 228 were taken from the Indonesian vessel, the Aceng, which was subequently intercepted by the Australian navy. Most parts of India have recorded above normal monsoon rainfall from 1 June to 1 August 2001 (26 out of 35 meteorological sub-divisions covering 75 % of the districts and 83 % area of the country received normal to excess rainfall). The torrential downpour which has been pounding the Indonesian island of Sumatra since last week is having dire consequences. Massive flooding occurring in Kenya has affected up to 70,000 people after torrential rains lashed many parts of the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Alarm Level II Dangerous flood condition - Flood plane inundation expected; towns and cities still generally protected by flood defences; high velocity River flows pose danger of bank and dyke erosion; bridge foundations at risk from scour; infrastructure generally safe. Conversely, the virtual absence of rainfall combined with abnormally high temperatures in most of southern Mozambique during the 2006/07 season may result in poor local harvests, especially for maize. Stress and labour migration continued well into 1999 because early warning mechanisms failed to predict and react timely to the disaster situation and furthermore, another belg rain failure in 1999 further aggravated the food security situation See Guinand, 1999b and Hammond, 1999b.

Critics have said that annual floods are worsened by bad irrigation systems and polluted rivers and waterways. An official added that the facilities are using Jhelum river water and are purifying all chemical and bacterial contamination.

Each family receives soap, purification tablets, aluminum sulphate and jerry cans. ""The solar pump system provides water to selected households at a lower price."". As was known, Bosnia and Herzegovina's hydropower-energy potential was huge, and more than half of its land was covered with forests, an excellent source of biomass energy, he said. Just one drop of chlorine purifies water for drinking, killing the cholera bacteria and other water-borne diseases. We do this by strengthening early warning systems and preparedness, like in Latin America; integrating disaster risk reduction with disaster response, as we did in Bangladesh; providing training such as improved farming methods in Afghanistan to help people withstand future disasters; and helping build resilience to the effects of climate change, as in Vietnam and Mozambique.
